# Single_pass_assembler

AIM
To write a program to implement single pass assembler(assembly code to machine code)

ALGORITHM
Step 1: Start a program

Step 2: Include header symbol_table.h and data_storage.h to get data from file and to implement symbol table.

Step 3: From the data of registers, assembly code, pseudo opcode and machine opcode(mnemonics code),branchcode create an symbol table ,literal table,Table of Incomplete Instruction(TII) and location counter(LC) is processed.

Step 4: To resolve forward references back-patching is done by TII.

STEP 5: Function pass() main function and content of the files are displayed.

STEP 6: Stop the program
